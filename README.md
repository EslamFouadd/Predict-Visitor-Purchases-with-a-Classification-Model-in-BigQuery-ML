# Predict-Visitor-Purchases-with-a-Classification-Model-in-BigQuery-ML

In this lab you will use a special ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery. You will this data to run some typical queries that businesses would want to know about their customers' purchasing habits.


# What you'll learn
In this lab, you learn to perform the following tasks:

Use BigQuery to find public datasets

Query and explore the ecommerce dataset

Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction

Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BigQuery ML

Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model

Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase
